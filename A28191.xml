            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can you own King <hi>William</hi> for your King ſeing King <hi>James</hi> is yet living?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ</hi> The Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> together with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> voted, That <hi>King James</hi> had Abdicated the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We look upon him that is King <hi>de facto</hi> to be King <hi>de jure;</hi> for we are told by a good Hiſtorian (in his Anſwer to <hi>Varillas)</hi> of a Law made by <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Poſſeſſion of the Crown, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the <hi>Legal King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Author of the late Farce called the <hi>Royal Flight,</hi> or the <hi>Conqueſt of Ireland,</hi> tells us, that to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a King <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> is a Jeſuitical Nicety, and works like <hi>Butter in a Cows Tail.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if King <hi>James</hi> hath Abdicated the Government, how can this Prejudice his Son the <hi>Prince of Wales?</hi> doth not his Right continue good ſtill?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have no <hi>good Aſſurance</hi> that there was ever any ſuch <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>late Queens</hi> Body, the <hi>whole Management</hi> of that Affair looks like a <hi>Popiſh Juggle</hi> and <hi>Cheat,</hi> put upon the Nation. <hi>Father Peters</hi> giving out that 'twould be a Son long before the

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> We have had War with <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, and may have again more than once tho' this had never been; and if we muſt all turn <hi>Quakers</hi> for fear of a War with <hi>France,</hi> 'tis as much as Monſieur looks for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may he not have too much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us, by reaſon of a Party that may be made amongſt us for this <hi>pretended young Prince?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Papiſts and <hi>Popiſhly affected</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48865:4"/> may be troubleſome, but a little <hi>wholſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity</hi> will make them pluck in their Horns and be glad to be quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if any thro' <hi>tenderneſs of Conſcience</hi> conceive themſelves oblidged to this <hi>young Prince,</hi> and that he ought to have all <hi>their good Wiſhes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Wiſhers and Woulders are <hi>no good Houſe holders;</hi> let them hold there and not diſturb the Peace of the Nation, and no body will molleſt them for the <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> of their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But will not this reflect upon the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that Princes of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſuaſion ſhould be barred from their <hi>Right,</hi> meerly becauſe of their difference from us in Religion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> is not qualifyed by the <hi>Laws of this Land</hi> to govern, nor ſo much as to live amongſt us, if the <hi>Law</hi> be followed againſt him. Now the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> doth not oblidge us to <hi>abandon our Laws and priviledges,</hi> (which we enjoy as <hi>Engliſh men)</hi> and hold up our <hi>Throats to a Popiſh Executioner,</hi> as long as we are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſecured by the Laws of this Land from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> can give us no <hi>Security</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48865:5"/> to govern us according to the known Laws of the Land; for the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> will <hi>abſolve</hi> him from his Oath, and make him their Tool wherewith to ruine both us and of our Religion</p>
            <p n="3">3. This cannot in the leaſt reflect upon our <hi>Religion:</hi> For here a great <hi>Prince</hi> apprehending a <hi>ſurreptitious Prince</hi> ſet up by Papiſts to debar <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Princeſs</hi> of their Rights, comes in with his <hi>Sword in his Hand</hi> in his own Vindication, and the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> came in before him, which ſtruck ſuch a Terrour into his Enemies, that they <hi>fled, and carried Young Perkin into another Land, a ſufficient Argument of their guilt;</hi> for it could be no Crime in the <hi>Midwife</hi> to deliver the Queen of a Son; neither had the pretended <hi>Young Prince</hi> been in any danger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proteſtants, who hate the <hi>Popiſh ways</hi> of ſending <hi>Young Princes</hi> out of the World by <hi>Italian Arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We have no reaſon to repent, that we ſuffered this <hi>brave Prince</hi> to enter quietly, according to our Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance;</hi> for we have <hi>chang'd Maſters</hi> to our better Advantage, having now a King that <hi>governs by Law, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades no mans Property, that hath no Jeſuites in his Council to beard the Reverend Biſhops of the King,</hi>
